UDID
====

Appcelerator Module to get the UDID from a iOS device

I have put this here as testflight still requires a UDID to track users properly and so this supports the TestFLight module in the Appc Marketplace

__DO NOT__ include this module in anyway in your production release. It will be rejected by Apple even if you don't actually call any of the methods! They do a static analysis now.
